# Challenge

This repository contains some programming puzzles I solve in my spare time for the sake of fun. I usually try to solve the exercises when I'm on the go (away from a computer) and write the code later on. Turns out to be a great way to challenge my brain.

> Exercises are partly taken from the book _Cracking the Coding Interview_ by Gayle Laakmann MacDowell. A great book for everyone who wants to refresh his computer science skills. Highly recommended!
