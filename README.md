# Challenge

Just a few random programming challenges I solved in my spare time. Code is written entirely by myself without looking at published solutions. I usually try to come up with a solution when I'm on the go (afk) and write the code later on. Turns out to be a great way to challenge my brain.

### Howto

Fork and/or clone the repo. Then setup gradle by executing this command once:

```
gradle wrapper
```

Now run the tests:

```
gradle test
```
